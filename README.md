# metars.mobi
metars.mobi mobile aviation METAR site.

This is an older project (uses knockout and jQuery mobile) but still gets a lot of use by me.  I put this up in case either someone wants to do a pull request (like how the warning class isn't applied to high winds that are also variable direction...) or if I get around to that full rewrite that I've been thinking of but just haven't done.

The backend isn't posted here at this time but it's just a thin wrapper over ADDS data services API.
